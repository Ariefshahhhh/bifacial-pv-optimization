### **Output Power Optimization of Bifacial Photovoltaic Module Using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm**

This project integrates:
- Bifacial PV output modeling  
- Environmental correction factors  
- AI-based optimization using ABC  
- Real-time results visualization  
- Multi-page Streamlit architecture  

The goal is to reduce the error between **calculated output** and **measured field data**, improving prediction accuracy.
